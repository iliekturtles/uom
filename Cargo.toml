# The `try-from` feature provides `impl TryFrom<Time> for Duration` and `impl TryFrom<Duration> for

# The `use_serde` feature exists so that, in the future, other dependency features like num/serde
# can be added. However, num/serde is currently left out because it has not yet been updated to
# Serde 1.0. It is also necessary to name the feature something other than `serde` because of a
# cargo bug: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1286
use_serde = ["serde"]

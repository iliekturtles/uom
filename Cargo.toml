# The `use_serde` feature exists so that, in the future, other dependency features like num/serde
# can be added. However, num/serde is currently left out because it has not yet been updated to
# Serde 1.0. It is also necessary to name the feature something other than `serde` because of a
# cargo bug: https://github.com/rust-lang/cargo/issues/1286

# Internal features to support channel specific test logic. Note that a
# channel's feature must be added to the `--features` list when compiling
# manually as no channel detection is build into `cargo`/`rustc`.

//! Units of measurement is a crate that does automatic type-safe zero-cost
//! [dimensional analysis][analysis]. You can create your own systems or use the pre-built
//! [International System of Units][si] (SI) which is based on the
//! [International System of Quantities][isq] (ISQ) and includes numerous [quantities][quantity]
//! (length, mass, time, ...) with conversion factors for even more numerous
//! [measurement units][measurement] (meter, kilometer, foot, mile, ...). No more crashing your
//! [climate orbiter][orbiter]!

//!
//! ## Usage
//! `uom` requires `rustc` 1.37.0 or later. Add this to your `Cargo.toml`:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! uom = "0.30.0"
//! ```
//!
//! and this to your crate root:
//!
//! ```rust
//! extern crate uom;
//! ```
//!
//! The simple example below shows how to use quantities and units as well as how `uom` stops
//! invalid operations:
//!
#![cfg_attr(all(feature = "si", feature = "f32"), doc = " ```rust")]
#![cfg_attr(not(all(feature = "si", feature = "f32")), doc = " ```rust,ignore")]
//! extern crate uom;
//!
//! use uom::si::f32::*;
//! use uom::si::length::kilometer;
//! use uom::si::time::second;
//!
//! fn main() {
//!     let length = Length::new::<kilometer>(5.0);
//!     let time = Time::new::<second>(15.0);
//!     let velocity/*: Velocity*/ = length / time;
//!     let _acceleration = calc_acceleration(velocity, time);
//!     //let error = length + time; // error[E0308]: mismatched types
//! }
//!
//! fn calc_acceleration(velocity: Velocity, time: Time) -> Acceleration {
//!     velocity / time
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! See examples provided with the source for more advanced usage including how to create `Quantity`
//! type aliases for a different set of base units and how to create an entirely new system of
//! quantities.
//!
//! ## Features
//! `uom` has multiple `Cargo` features for controlling available underlying storage types, the
//! inclusion of the pre-built [International System of Units][si] (SI), support for
//! [Serde][serde], and `no_std` functionality. The features are described below. `f32`, `f64`,
//! `std`, and `si` are enabled by default. Features can be cherry-picked by using the
//! `--no-default-features` and `--features "..."` flags when compiling `uom` or specifying
//! features in Cargo.toml:
//!
//! ```toml
//! [dependencies]
//! uom = {
//!     version = "0.30.0",
//!     default-features = false,
//!     features = [
//!         "autoconvert", # automatic base unit conversion.
//!         "usize", "u8", "u16", "u32", "u64", "u128", # Unsigned integer storage types.
//!         "isize", "i8", "i16", "i32", "i64", "i128", # Signed integer storage types.
//!         "bigint", "biguint", # Arbitrary width integer storage types.
//!         "rational", "rational32", "rational64", "bigrational", # Integer ratio storage types.
//!         "f32", "f64", # Floating point storage types.
//!         "si", "std", # Built-in SI system and std library support.
//!         "try-from", # `TryFrom` support between `Time` and `Duration`. Requires `rustc` 1.34.0.
//!         "use_serde", # Serde support.
//!     ]
//! }
//! ```
//!
//!  * `autoconvert` -- Feature to enable automatic conversion between base units in binary
//!    operators. Disabling the feature only allows for quantities with the same base units to
//!    directly interact. The feature exists to account for compiler limitations where zero-cost
//!    code is not generated for non-floating point underlying storage types.
//!  * `usize`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`, `isize`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`,
//!    `bigint`, `biguint`, `rational`, `rational32`, `rational64`, `bigrational`, `f32`, `f64` --
//!    Features to enable underlying storage types. At least one of these features must be enabled.
//!    `f32` and `f64` are enabled by default. See the [Design](#design) section for implications
//!    of choosing different
//!    underlying storage types.
//!  * `si` -- Feature to include the pre-built [International System of Units][si] (SI). Enabled by
//!    default.
//!  * `std` -- Feature to compile with standard library support. Disabling this feature compiles
//!    `uom` with `no_std`. Enabled by default.
//!  * `try-from` -- Feature to enable `TryFrom` support between `Time` and `Duration`. Requires
//!    `rustc` 1.34.0.
//!  * `use_serde` -- Feature to enable support for serialization and deserialization of quantities
//!    with the [Serde][serde] crate. Disabled by default.
//!

//!
//! ## Design
//! Rather than working with [measurement units](http://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/1.9.html) (meter,
//! kilometer, foot, mile, ...) `uom` works with [quantities](http://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/1.1.html)
//! (length, mass, time, ...). This simplifies usage because units are only involved at interface
//! boundaries: the rest of your code only needs to be concerned about the quantities involved.
//! This also makes operations on quantities (+, -, \*, /, ...) have zero runtime cost over using
//! the raw storage type (e.g. `f32`).
//!
//! `uom` normalizes values to the [base unit](http://jcgm.bipm.org/vim/en/1.10.html) for the
//! quantity. Alternative base units can be used by executing the macro defined for the system of
//! quantities (`ISQ!` for the SI). `uom` supports `usize`, `u8`, `u16`, `u32`, `u64`, `u128`,
//! `isize`, `i8`, `i16`, `i32`, `i64`, `i128`, `bigint`, `biguint`, `rational`, `rational32`,
//! `rational64`, `bigrational`, `f32`, and `f64` as the underlying storage type.
//!
//! A consequence of normalizing values to the base unit is that some values may not be able to be
//! represented or can't be precisely represented for floating point and rational underlying
//! storage types. For example if the base unit of `length` is `meter` and the underlying storage
//! type is `i32` then values like `1 centimeter` or `1.1 meter` cannot be represented. `1
//! centimeter` is normalized to `0.01 meter` which can't be stored in an `i32`. `uom` only allows
//! units to be used safely. Users of this library will still need to be aware of implementation
//! details of the underlying storage type including limits and precision.

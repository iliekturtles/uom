⚠ This crate is currently a placeholder for future development efforts. ⚠

`uom-macros` provides procedural macro support for `uom`. Two function-style macros are available.
`system!`, to define a system of quantities and a related system of units, and `quantity!`, to
define quantities within a system.  See the [`uom`](https://crates.io/crates/uom) crate for full
details.
